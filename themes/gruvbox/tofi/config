### Fonts
#
	# Font to use, either a path to a font file or a name.
	#
	# If a path is given, tofi will startup much quicker, but any
	# characters not in the chosen font will fail to render.
	#
	# Otherwise, fonts are interpreted in Pango format.

	# Comma separated list of OpenType font feature settings to apply,
	# if supported by the chosen font. The format is similar to the CSS
	# "font-feature-settings" property.

	#
	# font-features = "smcp, c2sc" (all small caps)
	# font-features = "liga 0" (disable ligatures)
	font-features = ""

	# Comma separated list of OpenType font variation settings to apply
	# to variable fonts. The format is similar to the CSS
	# "font-variation-settings" property.
	#
	# Examples:
	#
	# font-variations = "wght 900" (Extra bold)
	# font-variations = "wdth 25, slnt -10" (Narrow and slanted)

	#
	# A value of -1 means ignore exclusive zones completely.
	# A value of 0 will move tofi out of the way of other windows' zones.
